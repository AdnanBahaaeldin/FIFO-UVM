# FIFO Design Verification using SystemVerilog UVM

This repository provides a comprehensive **SystemVerilog UVM (Universal Verification Methodology)** testbench for verifying a **parameterized FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** design. It includes the RTL design, UVM environment, test sequences, scoreboard, functional coverage, and formal assertions.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

### Requirements
- **QuestaSim** or **ModelSim** simulator  
- **SystemVerilog** and **UVM** support

### Simulation Steps
1. Open a terminal in the project directory.
2. Run the following command to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   vsim -do run.do
3. This will compile all source files, execute the UVM testbench, and generate coverage data.

### ðŸ“Š Waveform and Coverage

- All interface signals are automatically added to the waveform window by the simulation script.  
- Coverage results are saved in `FIFO.ucdb`.
